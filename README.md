# Zaplet Landing Page

This project is part of [The Odin Project curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page). The goal for this project is to build a landing page using foundational HTML and CSS skills. For this project I will use SaaS landing page.

The page includes four main sections:

1. Hero Section: A bold introduction to the product with a clear call-to-action.
2. Features Section: Highlighting key product features with cards.
3. Testimonial Section: Adding credibility through a customer quote.
4. Call to Action Section: Final encouragement to convert visitors into users.

## Skills Demonstrated

By completing this landing page project, I will demonstrate:
- Structuring landing page layout using HTML
- Styling a clean interface using CSS and Flexbox.
- Organizing a project folder properly and practicing clean code habits.
- Using Git for version control and project tracking.
